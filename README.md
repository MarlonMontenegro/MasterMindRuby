# MasterMindRuby
This is a simple implementation of the classic "Mastermind" game in Ruby. The game offers two modes: one where the computer creates the secret code and the player guesses, and another where the player creates the secret code and the computer guesses. The game provides feedback on each guess to help the player or computer refine their subsequent attempts.

Modes
Mode 1: Player Creates, Computer Guesses
In this mode, you, the player, create the secret code, and the computer tries to guess it. The computer uses a basic strategy to narrow down the possibilities based on the feedback provided.

Mode 2: Computer Creates, Player Guesses
In this mode, the computer generates the secret code, and you, the player, need to guess it. After each guess, the computer provides feedback to help you deduce the correct code.
